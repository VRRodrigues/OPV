Codes used for applying Machine Learning to the prediction of device parameters of Organic Photovoltaic Cells

The parameters predicted were: Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE), Short Circuit Current (Jsc), Open Circuit Voltage (Voc) and Fill Factor (FF).

The primary datasets were sourced from the following publications:
1) https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.1c03526
2) https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b00635

Since the exact acceptor used in each donorâ€“acceptor pair of the original FA dataset was not provided, this information was manually collected from the 503 references cited in the dataset.
